#  Now that we know which shell and configuration file to execute
# start our xen-shell inside the new instance of GNU Screen.

#
#  Options we use:
#
# -d -R
#   Reattach a session and if necessary detach or even create it first.
#
# -c file
#   Override the default configuration file from "$HOME/.screenrc" to file
#
# -e^Aa
#   Explicitly set the escape sequence which GNU Screen should use.
#
# -s
#   set the login shell - this is the command which will run when the user
#  created a new window, or when the screen session starts/restarts.
#   
# -S
#   set the title of the screen session.
#

screen -d -R -c ${screenrc} -e^Aa -s ${xs}  -S $USER
